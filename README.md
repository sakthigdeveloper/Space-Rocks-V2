- Shields fully replenished when hitting any rock with a level 3 charged laser.  
- Shields recharged `+50` when a new wave starts.  

### Laser
Fire: `Space`, `Joystick Button 1`  
Hold Fire: `Charge laser`  

#### Charged Laser
3 levels of charged shot. Charging costs shield energy. It's a trade-off.  
  
1 - More damage  
2 - Even more damage - and the shot pierces through rocks, and destroys at least 1 generation of rock child spawn - Destroys UFOs in 1 hit.  
3 - Max damage - Destroys entire rock, preventing spawning more rocks, pierces through rocks - Destroys UFOs in 1 hit. ALSO replenishes shields to FULL if hit any rock.  

#### Shields
Automatically replenish over time. Shooting costs shield energy. Charged shots cost more shield energy, with each level more expensive than the previous one.
